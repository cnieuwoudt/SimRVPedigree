\usage{
trim_pedigree(ped_file, ascertain_span, num_affected, recall_probs)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped_file}{A data.frame. The ped file generated by \code{ped_step}.}

\item{ascertain_span}{numeric vector of length 2. The ascertainment period,
i.e. first and last year of study.}

\item{num_affected}{Numeric.  Number of affected individuals in ascertained pedigree. See details.}

\item{recall_probs}{Numeric.  Proband recall probabilities.  See details.}
}
\value{
The trimmed ped file
}
\description{
\code{trim_pedigree} chooses a proband from the pedigree and trims relatives
based on the proband's recall probability of that relative.
}
\details{
By default \code{recall_probs} is 4 times the kinship coefficent between the
proband and the probands relative, which results in a recall probability of
\eqn{2^{-(n-1)}} for a relative of degree \eqn{n}. Alternatively, the user may
specify a list of recall probabilites of length \eqn{l > 0}, in which case
the first \emph{l-1} items in \code{recall_probs} are the respective proband
recall probabilites for relatives of degree \emph{1, 2, ..., l-1}, and the
\emph{l}th item in \code{recall_probs} is the proband's recall probability for
all relatives of degree \strong{\emph{l} or greater}.  For example if
\code{recall_probs = c(1)} all relatives will be recalled by the proband with
probability 1.

Within the \code{trim_pedigree} function, the argument \code{num_affected} serves to determine which affected members may be selected as the proband, not to ensure the number of affected members in the trimmed pedigree, as in \code{sim_RVpedigree}.
For example, if there are only two affected members and \code{num_affected = 2}, then \code{trim_pedigree} will choose as the proband the second individual to experience onset, so that at the time of ascertainment the pedigree would have had two affected family members.  If \code{recall_probs != c(1)}, it is possible that proband will not recall the other affected.  Hence, the trimmed pedigree may have only 1 affected family member.
