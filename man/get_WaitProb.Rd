\title{Determine that cumulative probability of waiting time associated with a nonhomogenous Poisson process, given the time of the last event.}
\usage{
get_WaitProb(last_event, wait_time, hazard, part, scale = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{last_event}{a positive number.  The time at last event.}

\item{wait_time}{a positive number.  The waiting time to next_event.}

\item{hazard}{A vector of positive numbers.  The time-specific hazard rate.}

\item{part}{A vector of positive numbers.  Time partition over which to apply the time-specific hazard rate.}

\item{scale}{logical. By default scale = FALSE.  Specifying scale = TRUE ensures that this function is the CDF for a proper random variable.}
}
\value{
wait_prob The probability that the waiting time to next event is at least wait_time.
}
\description{
Determine that cumulative probability of waiting time associated with a nonhomogenous Poisson process, given the time of the last event.
