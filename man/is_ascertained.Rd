\title{Determine if a pedigree is ascertained}
\usage{
is_ascertained(ped_file, num_affected, ascertain_span, recall_probs)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped_file}{An object of class \code{ped}. A pedigree generated by \code{sim_ped} or \code{sim_RVped}, or an object created by the function \code{\link{new.ped}}.  See details.}

\item{num_affected}{Numeric.  The minimum number of affected individuals in the pedigree.}

\item{ascertain_span}{Numeric vector of length 2.  The year span of the ascertainment period.  This period represents the range of years during which the proband developed disease and the family would have been ascertained for multiple affected relatives.}

\item{recall_probs}{Numeric. The proband's recall probabilities for relatives, see details.  If missing, four times kinship coefficient between the proband and the relative is used.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following data frames:

\code{ascertained} Logical.  Indicates if pedigree is ascertained.
}
\description{
Intended priamrily as an internal function, \code{is_ascertained} checks to see if a pedigree returned by \code{\link{sim_ped}} is ascertained.
