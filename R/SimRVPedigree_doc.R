#' Randomly Simulate Pedigrees Ascertained for Disease Status.
#'
#' The \code{SimRVPedigree} package allows random simulation of pedigrees likely to be asertained for multiple affected members under a particular study design.  Pedigrees include individual specific variables such as birth year, and, when applicable, onset year, and/or death year.  Additionally, we simualte the transmission of a rare variant, assumed to increase disease susceptibility, according to Mendel's laws.
#'
#' In addition to randomly simulating pedigrees, \code{SimRVPedigree} also includes functions for: simulating waiting times associated with a non-homogeneous Poisson process, randomly simulating life events contingent on user-provided age-specific hazards.
